# brems_sim_B4c
Bremsstrahlung Simulation in B4C
Monte Carlo simulation of bremsstrahlung photon production using Geant4, with configurable target material, thickness, and beam energy. The project studies x-ray/gamma spectra generated by electrons interacting with high-Z materials (e.g., W, Ta, Pb) and B₄C shielding.
Overview
This repository contains a Geant4-based simulation for modeling bremsstrahlung radiation and energy deposition in a calorimeter geometry. It supports configurable:
Electron beam energy
Target material (W, Ta, Pb, etc.)
Target thickness
Detector scoring
Spectrum generation and visualization
The code outputs photon energy spectra and deposited energy for analysis and plotting.
